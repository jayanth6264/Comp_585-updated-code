                <p>The Pathfinder is a math and physics equation solver website for our class project Comp 585 User Interface Design. We as agroup decided to create this unique problem solving website due to our past experiences asComputer Science Majors.

                We all have had to take many levels of math and were required to take the physics courses catered for engineering. We know the struggles of needing quick and easy methods to help ensure the answers we solved are indeed correct. We have used and continue to use websites such as Wolfram Alpha and Symbolab to help with both math and physics. We used these websites as inspiration for our project. We want to create a similar website that is easy to use.
                
                We want to create a simple GUI that displays multiple bits of information at once instead of individually typing in the formula and selecting “=.” By doing so this will help decrease time spent typing up multiple formulas for the website to solve. We plan to develop a user-friendly interface that will have a math module and a physics module. Each module will have its respective set of equations.
                
                A user will select an equation and will be prompted to enter values for the variables and the program will automatically solve for the missing variable. Other bits of important information will also be displayed. Such as an equation’s second derivatives (if applicable) and so on. Our group will be bringing this idea to life by using Visual Studio (subject to change) and we will be coding in Python (subject to change). The user interface will be neatly designed using HTML, CSS (subject to change) and Java Script.
                
                You can find the code in master branch.!</p>
